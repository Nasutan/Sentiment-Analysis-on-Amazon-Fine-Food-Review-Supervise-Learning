## Result, Findings and Conclusion
**Overall Comparison:**\
Based on these results, Random Forest appears to be the best performing model overall. It has the highest accuracy on the single test set and the highest average accuracy across the folds.
  - However, it is important to consider the difference values as well. The fact that Random Forest's accuracy on the single test set is slightly higher than its average accuracy which suggests that its performance might be somewhat unstable where there is some variance in the model's performance when dealing with unseen data and less efficient in generalizing new data.
  - On the other hand, Logistic Regression shows more consistent performance across the folds, even though its overall accuracy is slightly lower than Random Forest.

\
**Conclusion :**\
By considering all evaluation and cross validated results,
  - Random Forest model is selected as the most suitable model in this case study.
